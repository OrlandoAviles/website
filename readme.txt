Creative Dojo 🥋

Development Training Grounds
Local-first · Single-file · No backend

Creative Dojo is my ongoing practice environment where I build a flagship RPG alongside the dev tools that support it (pixel art, writing tools, audio experiments, etc). Everything is built with vanilla JavaScript to strengthen fundamentals and keep the workflow fast.

---> ⭐ Main Game
Top-Down RPG + ATB / Paradigm Combat

A mobile-first top-down RPG prototype built in vanilla JavaScript. Explore a field scene with joystick controls and random encounters. Battles switch into an ATB-based “paradigm combat” system where party roles can be shifted under time pressure.

- Game Modules

TopDown.html — exploration + encounters + scene switching

FF13 3v1.html — ATB combat prototype module

---> 🛠️ Dev Tools

These tools support the flagship game and also serve as standalone practice projects.

-List.html — Lists / notes / tracking tool

-Journal.html — Daily writing + progress log

-PixelSpriteEditor.html — Pixel sprite / spritesheet editor

-Web Audio Beatpad — sound effects + loop generation (Web Audio API)

-Particle Engine — reusable FX system (hits, healing, UI polish)


---> 🗺️ Roadmap (Next Up)

Short-term focus is always: make the main game more playable and make the tools reusable.

-RPG

Paradigm presets (1 click shifts full party roles)

Target selection

Loot / XP / basic inventory loop

UI polish and transitions

-Tools

Beatpad presets for RPG sound pack

Particle Engine presets for combat + field effects

Pixel editor export improvements (spritesheet + metadata)

✨ Design Rules

These are intentional constraints:

Local-first (no accounts, no backend)

Single-file projects when possible

Fast iteration

Mobile-friendly input

Built with vanilla JS to master fundamentals
