# 🗝️ Tower of Veldara (ToV)

**Tower of Veldara (ToV)** is a procedural dungeon-crawler web game built as part of the **Creative Dojo** project ecosystem.

Climb a mysterious tower floor-by-floor, navigate room-and-corridor layouts, collect loot, survive boss encounters, and regroup in ritual **Safe Rooms** where the tower’s economy and secrets come alive.

ToV is a love letter to classic dungeon crawlers, built with modern web tech and a UI-first design philosophy.
